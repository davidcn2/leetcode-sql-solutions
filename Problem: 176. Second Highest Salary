# Problem: 176. Second Highest Salary

## Description

Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null.

## Intuition
Use `DENSE_RANK()` to assign ranks to distinct salary values. Then, filter for `rank = 2`.

## Approach
1. Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to assign ranks using `DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)`.  
   ✅ `ROW_NUMBER()` is not appropriate here because it assigns unique ranks even for duplicates, which could incorrectly pick one of the tied top salaries as the second highest.

2. Filter for `row_nbr = 2` to get the second highest distinct salary.  
   ✅ If no such salary exists, the result set will be empty.

3. Use `MAX()` to return the salary, or `NULL` if the second-highest does not exist.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: `O(n log n)` — due to sorting in the window function.
- **Space complexity**: `O(n)` — from the CTE and ranking buffer.

## Code
```sql
With cte_x as
  (
  Select
    salary,
    dense_rank() over (order by salary desc) as row_nbr
  From
    Employee
  )

Select
  max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
From
  cte_x
Where
  row_nbr = 2;
```

# LeetCode SQL Solutions

The repository contains my structured, well-documented solutions to **popular SQL problems on LeetCode**, with a focus on:

✅ Clean, readable, and efficient SQL (MySQL-focused)  
✅ Interview-style approaches using JOIN, GROUP BY, RANK, ROW_NUMBER, CTE, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, ...  
✅ Real-world BI/Data Analytics reasoning behind query choices.  
✅ Performance-aware patterns and edge case handling.

## Problem Coverage

Each file includes:
- **Problem description**
- **SQL logic and intuition**
- **Approach and reasoning**
- **Time/space complexity**
- **Working code with clean formatting**

---

## Topics Covered

- JOIN (inner, outer, self-joins, ...)
- GROUP BY and aggregates
- HAVING and filtering
- WINDOW FUNCTIONS (RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), DENSE_RANK(), ...)
- CTEs and subqueries
- NULL handling and data edge cases

## Why the Current Repo?

The repostory serves as more than a place for code.  The repository provides a **learning log** and **reference guide** I use to:
1. Improve query performance thinking.
2. Sharpen interview readiness.
3. Apply SQL patterns to real BI/analytics work.

# Problem: 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

## Problem
Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an employee, their name, salary, and the ID of their manager.

Write a solution to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

## Intuition
The table uses `managerId` to reference the employee manager from within the same dataset. The solution requires comparing salaries between rows in the same table (e.g., a self-join).

## Approach

1. **Alias the `Employee` table twice** — once as `emp` to represent the employee, and once as `mgr` to represent the manager.  
   ✅ Enables a self-join, allowing access to salary of both the employee and the manager in a single row context.

2. **Join the two aliases using `emp.managerId = mgr.id`**.  
   ✅ Matches each employee to their manager using the foreign key–primary key relationship defined by `managerId` → `id`.

3. **Apply a filter using `emp.salary > mgr.salary`**.  
   ✅ Excludes employee–manager pairs where the employee earns less than or the same as the manager, leaving only valid results.

4. **Select `emp.name` and rename the field as `Employee`**.  
   ✅ Aligns the result with the required output schema, ensuring LeetCode’s test validator accepts the solution.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: `O(n log n)` — from join processing and sorting on indexed fields (if available).
- **Space complexity**: `O(1)` — no additional memory outside the join structure.

## Code
```sql
Select
  emp.name as Employee
From
  Employee emp
    Inner Join Employee mgr On
      emp.managerId = mgr.id
Where
  emp.salary > mgr.salary;
```
